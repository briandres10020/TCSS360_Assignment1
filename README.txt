This is Assignment 1 for TCSS360.

Group members: Bri Andres, Alex Bell, Jerry Libago

Estimate time it took to produce solution:
    We all started working together on Thursday, discussing our progress with our individual solutions.
    At this point 1 of us was done and 2 of us had not finished the individual part. By Friday, we had
    all finished our individual solutions, and determined that Alex's code was the easiest to unit test,
    so we decided that would be our official submission. Saturday, we made the input generator and the first
    3/4 of the unit tests. Sunday finished unit tests, and did write up.
    This project took a total of four days to complete, due to busy schedules.

Any concerns:
We did not have any concerns with our implementations.
